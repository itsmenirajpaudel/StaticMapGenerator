# Static Map Generator

## Description
The Static Map Generator project is aimed at creating an image of a map location based on user input. Users can select a location on the map by pinpointing it or entering specific coordinates (latitude and longitude), choose zoom levels, and other parameters to generate a static map image. This project serves as a convenient tool for anyone needing static map images for various purposes.

## Purpose
The main purpose of this project is to provide users with a simple way to generate static map images based on their desired location and specifications. This can be useful for various applications such as embedding map images in websites, creating location-based documents, or simply visualizing geographical data.

## Use Case
An example use case for this application is as follows:
- A website developer needs to display a static map image of a specific location on their website.
- Instead of manually creating the map image, they can use this application to generate the image by providing the location coordinates and desired zoom level.
- The application generates a URL link to the static map image, which the developer can then embed into their website.

## Personal Note
This project was created primarily for learning purposes, particularly to gain experience with React. While the project serves a practical function by providing a static map generation tool, its main purpose was to explore React development concepts and practices.

## Technologies Used
- React: Frontend JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- (Add any other technologies/frameworks/libraries used)

## How to Use
To use the Static Map Generator, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/static-map-generator.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd static-map-generator
    ```

3. Install dependencies using npm:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

5. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to access the application.

6. Use the map interface to pinpoint a location or enter coordinates (latitude and longitude), select zoom levels, and any other parameters as needed.

7. Once you're satisfied with the settings, the application will generate a URL link to the static map image, which you can copy and use as needed.
